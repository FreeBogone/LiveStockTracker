# LiveStockTracker

## Currently Not Working
## To do:
####   Find new API with Live Data (Alpaca)
####   Find way to keep updating every nth minute / nth second
####   Find Graph that can live update, not just add another graph at every update
####   What do people look for when they go to sell a stock? find and program those as 'triggers' to buy/sell
## speculation: Simulate buying/selling?
####   Test different algorithms to determine which method can make the most profit
